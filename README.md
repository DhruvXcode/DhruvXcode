# ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Dhruv here

I use this GitHub as a **sandbox** to explore how **AI & Agents** can be applied to real-world finance problems, with no bs.

Too many people slap "agentic" on half-baked workflows just to ease their FOMO. I think theyâ€™re missing the real potential of this revolution. Through these **experiments**, Iâ€™m digging deeper. (*Note: these are not production-grade projects, just raw exploration.*)

### ðŸš€ About me
I'm a B.Com (Hons) student with a strong interest in **consulting, finance, business analysis, and market research**. I co-founded the **180 Degrees Consulting** branch at my college, part of the worldâ€™s largest student-led consultancy.

Iâ€™ve had a long-standing passion for Python and automation. Back in school, I combined that with my graphic design skills to build a variety of mini Python projectsâ€”just for the fun of creating.

Now, Iâ€™m focused on merging my finance background with technology, **experimenting** with how AI and agents can be used to solve **real-world problems**.
